## Lagrange polynomial

### (a)

Let $f(x)=\dfrac{1}{1+25x^2}$ be a function in $[-1,1]$, and let $p_n(x)$ be the polynomial of degree at most $n$ that interpolates the function $f$ at $n+1$ equally-spaced points $x_0,x_1,\cdots,x_n$ in the interval $[-1,1]$. Thus one gets
$$
h=\frac{2.0}{n}, x_k=-1.0+kh, k=0,1,\cdots,n
$$
.

$p_n(x)$ is an approximation of $f(x)$ at these points. Choose $n=5,10,20$ and compute $p_n(x)$ at
$$
x=-0.95,-0.47,0.1,0.37,0.93
$$
and compare them with $f(x)$ at these points.
